## Flow diagram
Start with our [flow diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tiLWoqP_GxfrIRk0ueaLKTCn-qOGUBZm/view?usp=sharing) to understand how you have to integrate our API 

## Backend documentation
We created a [postman API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3410894/UVRBmkmm) collection that you can copy and play with.


## Auto-generated product page 
Product page can be a pain to integrate on your website as you need to create one product page per country and languages. That's why we developed the 3 ways to easily integrate a product page auto generate by Qover on your website:
* popup product page [edit here in jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/harryqover/bx5go9fq/latest)
* redirection link [example](https://bike.qoverme.com/widget/product-page?lang=en&key=pk_F2654BC3CEC684D9ED1E&depreciation=false&damageDeductible=DAMAGE_DEDUCTIBLE_STANDARD_10PC&theftDeductible=THEFT_DEDUCTIBLE_STANDARD_10PC&country=BE)
* iframe [edit here in jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/harryqover/bx5go9fq/latest)
