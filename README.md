## 3. Backend guide
We created a [Postman API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3410894/UVRBmkmm) collection that you can copy and play with. The goal of this documentation is to give you a clear guide that can be followed when integrating the Qover API. 

Here are the sandbox keys that can be used for testing:
* **publicKey**: pk_1FAD97C4105B6A2B86EF
* **secretKey**: sk_FD5104AB36870002BCFE 

## 4. Frontend guide
[This guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18B_3NknhP_Z00uEzdHlv5f4V-HVwzry3/view?usp=sharing) gives you some more context when planning your integration and gives guidance on the frontend implementations that need to be done. 

### a. Auto-generated product page ###
In the Frontend documentation you will find some explanation on how to build a product page. A **product page** is a **standalone website page** entirely dedicated to the insurance product, it summarizes the product and serves as an FAQ for your customers. It is a **legal requirement** and it is **mandatory** to have this page per country and language. As this product page can be a pain to integrate, we developed **3 ways to easily integrate an auto-generated product page by Qover on your website**. You can find it [here](https://jsfiddle.net/harryqover/bx5go9fq/latest) in jsfiddle.
